# the Flexible Active in-band Network Telemetry
## Introduction
The data center network of cloud service providers or Internet companies carries a large amount of dynamic traffic, so it is
challenging to handle network problems such as silent failure and load imbalance. Fine-grained network visibility
helps network administrators promptly locate and solve the
above issues, which is very important for maintaining modern
large networks. Traditional network management protocols
such as SNMP, designed primarily for lower bandwidth
networks, employ inefficient polling measurement mechanisms
that work in controller-driven, per-device polling way. So it
cannot reach the ideal accuracy, coverage, and timeliness for
high-density data center network operations and maintenance
at this stage. INT allows packets to collect fine-grained measurements of the flow and the internal state of the device along
